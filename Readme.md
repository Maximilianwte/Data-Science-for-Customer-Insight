Welcome to the Data Science for Customer Insight Repository.

For your first task set you will need the "Data Science Introduction" Notebook. If you have no previous experience with programming using Python, first go to the "Python Introduction" Notebook. 

Note: Only the "Data Science Introduction" Notebook will be graded in the seminar, the "Python Introduction" Notebook is only optional to familiarize yourself with the most important concepts.

Later in the group projects you will need the "Group Project Framework".
